<p style="color:white;">According to Atlas and Boots,<q cite="https://www.atlasandboots.com/travel-blog/interesting-facts-about-k2/"> K2 got its name when in 1856 Thomas George Montgomerie – a British officer working for the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India – climbed a small mountain in Kashmir. He spotted two prominent peaks over 200km away in the Karakoram and named them K1 and K2, the ‘K’ standing for Karakoram. K1 was renamed Masherbrum – its local name. However, K2 appeared not to have a local name, possibly due to its remoteness.</q></p>

        It is estimated that between one in four or five K2 summiteers die on the mountain. This is a summit-to-death rate of around 22%. On Everest, this rate is estimated to be 3%. Annapurna is the only eight-thousander with a higher death rate at around 25%.
